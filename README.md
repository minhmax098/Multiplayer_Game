Getting into a room to play with (or againist) someone is very easy with Photon. 

There are basically three approaches: Either tell the server to find a matching room, follow a friend into their room, or get a list of rooms to let user pick one. 

We think, for modern games it's best to use quick and painless server-side matchmaking, so we discourge using room listings. 

Below, we will explain the options and things to keep in mind if you roll your own.
